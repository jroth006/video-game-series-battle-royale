<h1 style="color:grey;">What does it all mean?</h1>
<p style="color:white;"> We can take away a few notes from the data:
  1) Critic opinions have closely resembled user scores, until recently.
      When looking at the scores of all the series combined, that score differential has remained wthin +/- 6% since 1998.
      The score differential has grown over the last few years, propelled by the poorly-received releases of Street Fighter
      V and Mortal Kombat X.

  2) Sonic and Street Fighter are declining in quality, but in opposite ways.
      Critic scores for Street Fighter have remained consistent throughout the past 2 decades, but user scores have been
      decreasing since 2016, resulting in the largest negative score differentials for Street Fighter V and Street Fighter
      X Tekken.

      Sonic has been facing harsh critic reviews since 2001, with user scores being higher than the critic scores input
      12 out of last 13 years (Sonic Free Riders in 2010 was the outlier).

  3) Pokemon is immune to poor critic scores.
      Critic scores have been lower than user scores 60% of the time, and also contain the largest score differential with
      Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky (35%).
